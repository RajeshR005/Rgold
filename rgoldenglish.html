            <h2>✨ Golden Tips ✨</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>BIS Hallmark</strong> ensures the purity of gold jewellery. Purchasing hallmarked gold protects against quality issues and potential financial loss.
            </p>
    
            <div class="golden-tips-content">
                <h3>Understanding Gold Stamping & BIS Hallmark</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the years, various gold stampings like <strong>22 CT, KDM, 916 KDM, 88 KDM, 22/20 KDM</strong> have led to confusion and financial losses for gold sellers. To prevent this, the **Government of India** introduced the **BIS HALLMARK**, ensuring that all gold jewellery meets purity standards. This has eliminated quality concerns, improved trust, and enhanced gold recycling while reducing gold imports.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Preventing Gold Theft & Fraudulent Mortgages</h3>
                <p>
                    As gold prices rise, so do instances of theft and fraudulent mortgages. Some gold trading companies accept fake identities, conduct unauthorized auctions, and fail to report suspicious activities. This has led to unethical gold dealings, affecting genuine sellers and buyers.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Cash For Gold - R-Gold: A Trusted Gold Exchange</h3>
                <p>
